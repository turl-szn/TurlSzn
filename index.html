<p>This one child from a rival school died after substance abuse. I was deeply affected by his loss so I 
  decided to spent the year off in order to reconsider my career options. However COMMA I don't have any money 
  in order to pay for this entire year off. Actually.. I only have friends. This kid David Mosden wrote this entire code for 
  me as I'm crying listening to Jaden's sophomore album. I'm on track K right now. He's a great artist he's just mad young 
  so he'll be fine. I have plenty of shooters who recognize this struggle so I'll be chillin' for just about my entire life. 
  I really do hope that guy who throws footballs makes the league he's kinda the best quarterback I've ever seen throw a football. 
  I'm not joking. Latur DAWG..</p>
